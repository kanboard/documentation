Swimlanes are horizontal separations in your board.
For example, they are useful for separating software releases, dividing tasks by different products, teams, or any other criteria.

Board with Swimlanes
--------------------

![Board with Swimlanes](/images/v1/swimlanes.png)

- You can collapse swimlanes by clicking on the icon on the left.
- The default swimlane is always shown at the top.

Managing Swimlanes
------------------

- All projects have a default swimlane.
- If there is more than one swimlane, the board will display all swimlanes.
- You can drag and drop tasks between swimlanes.

To configure swimlanes, go to the **project configuration page** and choose the section **Swimlanes**.

From there, you can add a new swimlane or rename the default one.
You can also disable or change the position of different swimlanes.

- The default swimlane is always at the top, but you can hide it.
- Inactive swimlanes are not shown on the board.
- **Removing a swimlane does not remove tasks assigned to it**; those tasks will be moved to the default swimlane.
