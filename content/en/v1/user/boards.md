Project Views
-------------

For each project, tasks can be visualized with several views: **Board, Calendar, List, and Gantt**.
Each view shows the result of the filter box at the top.

### Board View

- With this view, you can drag and drop tasks between columns easily.
- You can also use the keyboard shortcut **"v b"** to switch to the board view.
- Tasks with a shadow have been modified recently.

![Task Limit](/images/v1/board-task-limit.png)

When the task limit is reached for a column, the background becomes red.
This indicates that there are too many tasks in progress at the same time.

### List View
