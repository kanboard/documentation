To minimize user interaction, Kanboard supports automated actions.

Each automatic action is defined by these properties:

- An event to listen to
- An action linked to the event
- Additional parameters

Each project has a different set of automatic actions.
The configuration panel is located on the project listing pageâ€”just click on the link **Automatic actions**.

Examples

Here are some examples used in real life:

### When I move a task to the column "Done," automatically close this task

- Choose the action: **Close a task in a specific column**.
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**.
- Define the action parameter: **Column = Done** (this is the destination column).

### When I move a task to the column "To be validated," assign this task to a specific user

- Choose the action: **Assign the task to a specific user**.
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**.
- Define the action parameters: **Column = To be validated** and **User = Bob** (Bob is our tester).

### When I move a task to the column "Work in progress," assign this task to the current user

- Choose the action: **Assign the task to the person who performs the action when the column is changed**.
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**.
- Define the action parameter: **Column = Work in progress**.

### When a task is completed, duplicate this task to another project

Let's say we have two projects: "Customer orders" and "Production."
Once the order is validated, move it to the "Production" project.

- Choose the action: **Duplicate the task to another project**.
- Choose the event: **Closing a task**.
- Define the action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Production**.

### When a task is moved to the last column, move the exact same task to another project

Let's say we have two projects: "Ideas" and "Development."
Once the idea is validated, move it to the "Development" project.

- Choose the action: **Move the task to another project**.
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**.
- Define the action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Development**.

### I want to assign a color automatically to the user Bob

- Choose the action: **Assign a color to a specific user**.
- Choose the event: **Task assignee change**.
- Define the action parameters: **Color = Green** and **Assignee = Bob**.

### I want to assign a color automatically to the defined category "Feature Request"

- Choose the action: **Automatically assign a color based on a category**.
- Choose the event: **Task creation or modification**.
- Define the action parameters: **Color = Blue** and **Category = Feature Request**.

### I want to set the start date automatically when the task is moved to the column "Work in progress"
