Subtasks are useful for splitting the work of a task.

Each subtask:

- Can be assigned to a project member.
- Has one of three statuses: **Todo**, **In progress**, **Done**.
- Has time tracking information: **time spent** and **time estimated**.
- Is ordered by position.

Creating Subtasks
-----------------

From the task view, click on **Add a subtask** in the left sidebar:

You can also add a subtask quickly by entering only the title:

Changing Subtask Status
-----------------------

When you click on the subtask title, the status changes:

![Subtask in progress](/images/v1/subtask-status-inprogress.png)

The icon before the title updates according to the status.

![Subtask completed](/images/v1/subtask-status-done.png)

Note: When the task is closed, all subtasks are changed to the status **Done**.

Subtask Timer
-------------

- Each time a subtask is in progress, the timer starts automatically. The timer can be started and stopped at any time.
- The timer records the time spent on the subtask automatically. You can also manually change the value of the time spent field when editing a subtask.
- The calculated time is rounded to the nearest quarter.
- This information is recorded in a separate table.
- The task's time spent and time estimated values are updated automatically based on the sum of all subtasks.
