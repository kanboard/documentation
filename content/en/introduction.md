## Introduction

Kanban is a methodology originally developed by Toyota to be more
efficient.

There are only two constraints imposed by Kanban:

- Visualize your workflow
- Limit your work in progress

## Visualize your workflow

- Your work is displayed on a board so that you have a clear overview
   of your project
- Each column represents a step in your workflow

## Limit your work in progress

- Encourages focus by avoiding multitasking
- Each phase can have work-in-progress limits
- Limits help identify bottlenecks
- Limits help avoid working on too many tasks at the same time

## Performance Measurement

Kanban uses lead and cycle times to measure performance:

- **Lead time**: Time between task creation and completion
- **Cycle time**: Time between task start and completion

For example, you may have a lead time of 100 days but only have to work 1 hour to complete the task.

## Kanban vs Todo lists

### Todo lists

- Single phase (just a list of items)
- Multitasking possible (not efficient)

### Kanban

- Multiple phases, each column represents a step
- Bring focus and avoid multitasking by setting a work-in-progress limit per column

## Kanban vs Scrum

### Scrum

- Sprints are time-boxed, usually 2 or 4 weeks
- Do not allow changes during the iteration
- Estimation is required
- Uses velocity as default metric
- Scrum board is cleared between sprints
- Scrum has pre-defined roles like scrum master, product owners and the
   team
- A lot of meetings: planning, backlogs grooming, daily stand-up,
   retrospective

### Kanban

- Continuous flow
- Changes can be made at any time
- Estimation is optional
- Use lead and cycle time to measure performance
- Kanban board is persistent
- Kanban doesn’t impose strict constraints or meetings; the process is more flexible
