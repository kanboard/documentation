## Introduction

Kanban is a methodology originally developed by Toyota to improve efficiency.

There are only two constraints imposed by Kanban:

- Visualize your workflow
- Limit your work in progress

## Visualize your workflow

- Your work is displayed on a board, providing a clear overview of your project.
- Each column represents a step in your workflow.

## Limit your work in progress

- Encourages focus by avoiding multitasking.
- Each phase can have work-in-progress limits.
- Limits help identify bottlenecks.
- Limits help avoid working on too many tasks simultaneously.

## Performance Measurement

Kanban uses lead and cycle times to measure performance:

- **Lead time**: The time between task creation and completion.
- **Cycle time**: The time between task start and completion.

For example, you may have a lead time of 100 days but only need to work 1 hour to complete the task.

## Kanban vs Todo Lists

### Todo Lists

- Single phase (just a list of items).
- Multitasking is possible (not efficient).

### Kanban

- Multiple phases, with each column representing a step.
- Brings focus and avoids multitasking by setting a work-in-progress limit per column.

## Kanban vs Scrum

### Scrum

- Sprints are time-boxed, usually 2 or 4 weeks.
- Changes are not allowed during the iteration.
- Estimation is required.
- Uses velocity as the default metric.
- The Scrum board is cleared between sprints.
- Scrum has predefined roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the team.
- Involves many meetings: planning, backlog grooming, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

### Kanban

- Continuous flow.
- Changes can be made at any time.
- Estimation is optional.
- Uses lead and cycle times to measure performance.
- The Kanban board is persistent.
- Kanban doesnâ€™t impose strict constraints or meetings; the process is more flexible.
