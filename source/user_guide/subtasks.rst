Subtasks
========

Subtasks are useful to split the work of a task.

Each subtask:

-  Can be assigned to a project member
-  Has 1 of 3 different statuses: **Todo**, **In progress**, **Done**
-  Has time tracking information: **time spent** and **time estimated**
-  Is ordered by position

Creating Subtasks
-----------------

From the task view, on left sidebar click on **Add a subtask**:

You can also add a subtask quickly by entering only the title:

Changing Subtask Status
-----------------------

When you click on the subtask title the status change:

.. figure:: /_static/subtask-status-inprogress.png
   :alt: Subtask in progress

The icon before the title is updated according to the status.

.. figure:: /_static/subtask-status-done.png
   :alt: Subtask done

Note: When the task is closed, all subtasks are changed to the status
**Done**.

Subtask Timer
-------------

-  Each time a subtask is in progress, the timer is also started. The
   timer can be started and stopped at any time.
-  The timer records the time spent on the subtask automatically. You
   can also change manually the value of the time spent field when you
   edit a subtask.
-  The time calculated is rounded to the nearest quarter. This
   information is recorded in a separate table.
-  The task time spent and time estimated is updated automatically
   according to the sum of all subtasks.
