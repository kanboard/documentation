Project Views
-------------

For each project, tasks can be visualized with several views: **Board,
Calendar, List and Gantt**. Each view shows the result of the filter box
at the top.

When the task limit is reached for a column, the background becomes red.
That means there are too many tasks in progress at the same time.

Horizontal Scrolling and Compact Mode
-------------------------------------

When the board cannot fit on your screen, a horizontal scroll bar will
appear at the bottom.

However, itâ€™s possible to switch to the compact the view to display all
columns in your screen.
