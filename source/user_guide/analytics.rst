Project Analytics
=================

Each project has an analytics section. Depending on how you are using
Kanboard, you can see those reports:

User Repartition
----------------

   :alt: User repartition

This pie chart show the number of open tasks assigned per user.

Task Distribution
-----------------

   :alt: Task distribution

This pie chart gives an overview of the number of open tasks per column.

Cumulative Flow Diagram
-----------------------

.. figure:: /_static/cfd.png
   :alt: Cumulative flow diagram

-  This chart shows the number of tasks cumulatively for each column
   over the time.
-  The legend order is the same as the stack in the chart.
-  The color of each column is determined automatically.
-  Every day, the number of tasks is recorded for each column.
-  If you would like to exclude closed tasks, change the global project
   settings.

Note: You need to have at least two days of data to see the graph.

Burn Down Chart
---------------

   :alt: Burndown chart

The `burn down chart <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart>`__
is available for each project.

-  This chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus
   time.
-  Kanboard use the complexity or story point to generate this diagram.
-  Everyday, the sum of the story points for each column is calculated.

Average Time Spent Into Each Column
-----------------------------------

.. figure:: /_static/average-time-spent-into-each-column.png
   :alt: Average time spent into each column

This chart shows the average time spent into each column for the last
1000 tasks.

-  Kanboard uses the task transitions to calculate the data.
-  The time spent is calculated until the task is closed.

Average Lead and Cycle time
---------------------------

.. figure:: /_static/average-lead-cycle-time.png
   :alt: Average time spent into each column

This chart show the average lead and cycle time for the last 1000 tasks
over time.

-  The lead time is the time between the task creation and the date of
   completion.
-  The cycle time is time between the specified start date of the task
   to the completion date.
-  If the task is not closed, the current time is used instead of the
   date of completion.

Those metrics are calculated and recorded every day for the whole
project.
