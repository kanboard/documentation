| Project      | user management                                       |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

-  Only Administrators and Application Managers can create team
   projects.
-  Personal projects can be created by anyone.

Creating Projects
-----------------

Kanboard can handle multiple projects.

Creating Projects for Multiple Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Only administrators and managers can create those projects
-  User management is available

From the dashboard, click on the link **New project**:

   Project creation form

It’s very easy: you just have to find a name for your project!

Creating a Personal Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Anybody can create a personal project
-  There is **NO** user management
-  Only the owner and administrators can access the project

From the dashboard, click on the link **New personal project**.

Creating Projects from Another Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new project, you can choose to duplicate the properties of another project:

-  Permissions
-  Actions
-  Swimlanes
-  Categories
-  Tasks

Editing Projects
----------------

Projects can be modified at any time.

To rename a project, just click on the link entitled **"Edit project"** on the left.

   :alt: Project edition

-  The start date and end date are used to generate the project Gantt chart.
-  The description is visible as a tooltip on the board and on the projects listing page.
-  Administrators and project administrators can convert a personal
   project to a multiple-user project by changing the checkbox "Personal
   project".
-  You can also convert a multiple-user project to a personal project.

Note: When you make a project personal, all existing users will still
have access to the project. You must adjust the list of users according
to your needs.

Removing Projects
-----------------

To remove a project, you must be the manager of the project or an administrator.

Go to the **"Project settings"**, and from the menu on the left, at the bottom, choose **"Remove"**.

.. figure:: /_static/project-remove.png
   :alt: Removing Projects

Removing a project removes all tasks that belong to this project.

Project Permissions
-------------------

Each project is isolated from other projects. Project access must be
allowed by the project owner.

Each user and each group can have a different role assigned. There are 3
types of roles for projects:

-  Project Manager
-  Project Member
-  Project Viewer

Only administrators have access to everything.

Role assignments are visible in **Project Settings > Permissions**:

.. figure:: /_static/project-permissions.png
   :alt: Project Permissions

Personal projects cannot define permissions.

Custom Project Roles
--------------------

You can create custom project roles to apply a set of specific
restrictions on the people that belong to this role. These custom roles
are defined for each project.

A custom role inherits from the project member role. For example, you
may want to create a custom role to force someone to follow a process.
You can have a group of people that are allowed to move tasks only from
the column “Work in progress” to the column “Done”.

Sharing Boards and Tasks
------------------------

By default, boards are private, but it’s possible to make a board public.

A public board **cannot be modified: it has read-only access**.
Access is protected by a random token. Only people who have the correct URL can see the board.

Public boards are automatically refreshed every 60 seconds.
Task details are also available in read-only mode.

Usage examples:

-  Share your board with someone outside of your organization
-  Display the board on a large screen in your office

Enable Public Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select your project, then click on **"Public access"** and finally click on the button **"Enable public access"**.

.. figure:: /_static/project-enable-sharing.png
   :alt: Enable public access

When public access is enabled, a couple of links are generated:

-  Public board view
-  RSS feed subscription link
-  iCalendar subscription link

.. figure:: /_static/project-disable-sharing.png
   :alt: Disable public access

You can also disable public access whenever you want.

Each time you enable or disable public access, a new random token is
generated. **The previous links will not work anymore**!

Custom Filters
--------------

Custom filters allow you to save any search query. In this way, you can
extend the default filters easily and save most used search queries.

-  Custom filters are stored by project and associated to the creator.
-  If the creator is project manager, he can choose to share the filter
   with other project members.

Filter Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the action drop-down or in the project settings and choose
**custom filters**:

After creating your filter, it will appear on the board next to the
default filters:
