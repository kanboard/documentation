Advanced Search Syntax
======================

Kanboard uses a simple query language for advanced search. You can
search in tasks, comments, subtasks, links but also in the activity
stream.

Example of Query
----------------

This example will return all tasks assigned to me with a due date for
tomorrow and a title that contains “my title”:

::

    assigne:me due:tomorrow my title

Project Search
--------------

Search by task id or title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Search by task id and task title: ``123``
-  Search by task title: anything that doesn’t match any search
   attributes

Search by status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute: **status**

-  Query to find open tasks: ``status:open``
-  Query to find closed tasks: ``status:closed``

Search by assignee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute: **assignee**

-  Query with the username: ``assignee:fguillot``
-  Multiple assignee lookup: ``assignee:user1 assignee:"John Doe"``
-  Query for unassigned tasks: ``assignee:nobody``
-  Query for my assigned tasks: ``assignee:me``

Search by task creator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute: **creator**

Search by color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute: **color**

-  Search tasks without a due date: ``due:none``

The date must use the ISO 8601 format: **YYYY-MM-DD**.

All string formats supported by the ``strtotime()`` function are
supported, for example ``next Thursday``, ``-2 days``, ``+2 months``,
``tomorrow``, etc.

Operators supported with a date:

-  Greater than: **due:>2015-06-29**
-  Lower than: **due:<2015-06-29**
