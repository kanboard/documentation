Sqlite
======

Kanboard uses Sqlite by default to store its data. All tasks, projects
and users are stored inside this database.

Technically, the database is just a single file located inside the
directory ``data`` and named ``db.sqlite``.

Export/Backup
-------------

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doing a backup is very easy, just copy the file ``data/db.sqlite``
somewhere else when nobody use the software.

If you want to do a backup while users are connected, you can use ``sqlite3``
to create the backup.

- You can dump the database to a text file of sql commands like this: ``sqlite3 db.sqlite .dump > kanboard.dump.sql``

- Another option is to create a backup in sqlite format: ``sqlite3 db.sqlite ".backup kanboard.backup.sqlite"``


User interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also download at any time the database directly from the
**settings** menu.

The downloaded database is compressed with Gzip, the filename becomes
``db.sqlite.gz``.

Import/Restoration
------------------

There is actually no way to restore the database from the user
interface. The restoration must be done manually when no body use the
software.

-  To restore an old backup, just replace and overwrite the actual file
   ``data/db.sqlite``.
-  To uncompress a gzipped database, execute this command from a
   terminal ``gunzip db.sqlite.gz``.
-  A backup in sql format, can be restored like this: ``sqlite3 db.sqlite < kanboard.dump.sql`` (db.sqlite must not exist)
-  A backup in sqlite format, can be restored like this: ``sqlite3 db.sqlite ".restore kanboard.backup.sqlite"`` 

Optimization
------------

Occasionally, it’s possible to optimize the database file by running the
command ``VACUUM``. This command rebuild the entire database and can be
used for several reasons:

-  Reduce the file size, deleting data produce empty space but doesn’t
   change the file size.
-  The database is fragmented due to frequent inserts or updates.

From the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sqlite3 data/db.sqlite 'VACUUM'

From the user interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the menu **settings** and click on the link **Optimize the
database**.

For more information, read the `Sqlite
documentation <https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html>`__.
