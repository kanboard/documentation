How can I help?
---------------

Kanboard is not perfect but there are many ways to help:

-  Report bugs
-  Add or update translations
-  Improve the documentation
-  Write code

Before doing any large undertaking, open a new issue and explain your
proposal.

I want to report a bug
----------------------

-  Check if the issue is not already reported
-  Open a new ticket
-  Explain what is broken
-  Describe how to reproduce the bug
-  Describe your environment (Kanboard version, OS, web server, PHP
   version, database version, hosting provider)

I want to translate Kanboard
----------------------------

Kanboard is translated in many languages.
You could improve existing translations or add new ones.

I want to improve the documentation
-----------------------------------

-  You think something is not clear, there is grammatical errors, typo
   errors, anything.
-  The documentation is written in Markdown and stored in the folder
   ``docs``.
-  Edit the files and send a pull-request.
-  The documentation on the official website is synchronized with the
   repository.

I want to contribute to the code
--------------------------------

Pull-requests are always welcome however, to be accepted you have to
follow those directives:

-  **Before doing any large change or design proposal, open a new ticket
   to start a discussion.**
-  If you want to add a new feature, respect the philosophy behind
   Kanboard. **We focus on simplicity**, we don’t want to have a bloated
   software.
-  The same apply for the user interface, **simplicity and efficiency**.
-  Send only one pull-request per feature or bug fix.
-  A smaller pull-request is easier to review and it will be merged faster.
-  Make sure the unit tests pass.
-  Respect the coding standards.
-  Write maintainable code, avoid code duplication, use PHP good
   practices.

In any case, if you are not sure about something open a new ticket.
