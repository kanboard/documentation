Automated Tests
===============

`PHPUnit <https://phpunit.de/>`__ is used to run automated tests on Kanboard.

You can run tests across different databases (Sqlite, Mysql and
Postgresql) to be sure that the result is the same everywhere.

Requirements
------------

-  Linux/Unix machine
-  PHP
-  PHPUnit installed
-  Mysql and Postgresql (optional)
-  Selenium (optional)
-  Firefox (optional)

Unit Tests
----------

Test with Sqlite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sqlite tests use a in-memory database, nothing is written on the file
system.

The PHPUnit config file is ``tests/units.sqlite.xml``. From your
Kanboard directory, run the command
``phpunit -c tests/units.sqlite.xml``.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    phpunit -c tests/units.sqlite.xml

    PHPUnit 5.0.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    ............................................................... 630 / 649 ( 97%)
    ...................                                             649 / 649 (100%)

    Time: 1.22 minutes, Memory: 151.25Mb

    OK (649 tests, 43595 assertions)

Test with Mysql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Mysql or MariaDb installed on localhost.

By default, those credentials are used:

-  Hostname: **localhost**
-  Username: **root**
-  Password: none
-  Database: **kanboard_unit_test**

For each execution the database is dropped and created again.

The PHPUnit config file is ``tests/units.mysql.xml``. From your Kanboard
directory, run the command ``phpunit -c tests/units.mysql.xml``.

Test with Postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Postgresql installed on localhost.

By default, those credentials are used:

-  Hostname: **localhost**
-  Username: **postgres**
-  Password: none
-  Database: **kanboard_unit_test**

Be sure to allow the user ``postgres`` to create and drop databases. The
database is recreated for each execution.

The PHPUnit config file is ``tests/units.postgres.xml``. From your
Kanboard directory, run the command
``phpunit -c tests/units.postgres.xml``.

Integration Tests
-----------------

Integration tests are mainly used to test the API. The test suites are
making real HTTP calls to the application that run inside a container.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  PHP
-  Composer
-  Unix operating system (Mac OS or Linux)
-  Docker
-  Docker Compose

Running integration tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integration tests are using Docker containers. There are 3 different
environment available to run tests against each supported database.

You can use these commands to run each test suite:

.. code:: bash

    # Run tests with Sqlite
    make integration-test-sqlite

    # Run tests with Mysql
    make integration-test-mysql

    # Run tests with Postgres
    make integration-test-postgres

Acceptance Tests
----------------

Acceptance tests (also sometimes known as end-to-end tests, and
functional tests) test the actual functionality of the UI in a browser
using Selenium.

In order to run these tests you must have `Selenium Standalone
Server <http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/>`__ installed, and a
compatible version of Firefox.

The PHPUnit config file is ``tests/acceptance.xml``. With Selenium and
the Kanboard app running, from your Kanboard directory, run the command
``make test-browser``. This will initiate the testing suite and you will
see Firefox open automatically and perform the actions specified in the
acceptance tests.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ make test-browser
    PHPUnit 4.8.26 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    ..

    Time: 5.59 seconds, Memory: 5.25MB

    OK (2 tests, 5 assertions)

Continuous Integration with Travis-CI
-------------------------------------

After each commit pushed on the main repository, unit tests are executed
across various versions of PHP:

-  PHP 7.4
-  PHP 7.3
-  PHP 7.2

Each version of PHP is tested against the 3 supported database: Sqlite,
Mysql and Postgresql.

The Travis config file ``.travis.yml`` is located on the root directory
of Kanboard.
